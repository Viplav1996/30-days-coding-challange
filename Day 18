Advance Airthmetic divisor, that's cool man

For eg, Logic flow, if input is 6, advance aithmetic sum will add all the factors divisible by 6
and that is gonna produce a sum in the last, which will be (1+2+3+6 =)12 and return it



def divCal(n):
    tot=0
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if n%i == 0:
            tot+=i
        else :
            pass
    return print(tot)

divCal(8)
